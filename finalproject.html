<h1>Final Project</h1>

<p>So for the Final Project of the CSC 106 course, me and my partner making a game called "BlackJack!" <br>
To make this game, me and my partner working together to make the Blackjack game look and works like the real game itself. <br>
The player can choose poker chips and betting to amount of money that the player want, <br> 
the card that they receive is also random for each game, and we try to make the game appearance <br>
looks exactly like a real blackjack table. <br>
<br>
To help the player play the game, we also add an instruction button <br>
as a guidance on how to play the game for people who don't understand how the game works. <br>
The instructions: <br>
* To begin, each player is dealt two cards (from a normal deck of 52). <br>
* All cards have value of 2-10. (Face cards = 10). An Ace can be 1 or 11. <br>
* The goal is for the total of the cards to be as close to 21 as possible. <br>
* If the total of the cards is exactly 21 you win. <br>
* If the total of the cards goes over 21 you lose. <br>
* If there is a tie, the hand will continue until there is a winner. <br>
* Betting increments are set with: 5$, 10$, 15$, and 20$ chips. <br>
